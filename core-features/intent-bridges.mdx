title: 'Intent-Based Bridges'
description: 'Simplifying Cross-Chain Transactions Through User Intent'
---

## Overview

Intent-based bridges focus on abstracting the complexity of cross-chain transactions by allowing users to specify their intent (e.g., "Swap USDT on Chain A to ETH on Chain B") without worrying about the underlying mechanics.

## How They Work

### 1. User Intent Declaration
- Users specify desired outcomes
- Simple, human-readable transaction requests
- Abstracted complexity

### 2. Automated Pathfinding
- Intelligent route optimization
- Multi-hop transaction support
- Cross-chain DEX integration

### 3. Execution
- Automated transaction handling
- Liquidity pool optimization
- Cross-chain settlement
