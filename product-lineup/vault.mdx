## Overview

Vault is a chain‑agnostic smart account that abstracts keys, gas, and cross‑chain complexity. It powers seamless transactions with account abstraction and policy controls.

## Key Capabilities

- Account Abstraction (AA) with session keys and policies
- Gasless UX via TIPAY
- Cross‑chain actions coordinated through Axon
- Recovery and programmable authorization

## SDK Quickstart

```typescript
import { Trikon } from '@trikon/sdk';

const trikon = new Trikon({ apiKey: process.env.TRIKON_API_KEY });
const wallet = await trikon.vault.create({ owner: '<EVM_ADDRESS>' });

// Send without native gas on destination chain
await wallet.send({
  chain: 'zksync',
  to: '<DEST_ADDRESS>',
  asset: 'USDC',
  amount: '25'
});
```
